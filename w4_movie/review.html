        <h1>Grown Ups</h1>
        <div id="movie_info2">
            <p> The Movie GrownUps has always been a life long movie that I have always enjoyed watching with my family and friends. Especially when hanging out with all of my friends because of it reminds us of all the fun and <i>dumb</i> things we like to do. Personally I would give this movie a 9/10 rating because of its originality and great laughs made everytime watched. </p>
